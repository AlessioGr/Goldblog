This is my first post on my new ~~fake~~ real blog! How exciting!

My needs for a blog are pretty simple:

-   Simple, pleasing aesthetics
-   Easy authoring editing experience
-   Automatic SEO tags

I've been becoming steadily angrier at Medium for the last two years over their abysmal code highlighting support.

## Code Highlighting

This is code highlighting with Gatsby's [official PrismJS plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-remark-prismjs):

```typescript
const greet = (name: string) => {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};
```
