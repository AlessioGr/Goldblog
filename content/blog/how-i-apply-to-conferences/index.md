title: "How I Apply to Conferences"
---

As of October 2022, I've applied to about 100 unique conferences and gotten accepted to about a third of them.
I've also started helping out organizing conferences, such as reviewing talks submitted by speakers.
So while I'm not the greatest conference speaker in the world, I think I've gotten at least good at them.

This blog post goes over the process that I take to submit my talks to CFPs (Call For Proposals).
That process can be summarized in the following steps:

1. [Pre-Work](#1-pre-work)
1. [Research the conference](#2-research-the-conference)
1. [Determine topic matches](#3-determine-topic-matches)
1. [Sketch the story](#4-sketch-the-story)
1. [Submit the CFP](#5-submit-the-cfp)
1. [Don't get my hopes up](#6-dont-get-my-hopes-up)

## 1. Pre-Work

Speaking at a conference is rarely the first bit of community involvement speakers take.
It's a good idea to start smaller so you can build your skills and network with other people in your areas of programming.

If you're interested in getting started talking about programming topics, a strategy like this one with meetups can be very helpful:

1.  Start attending meetups, such as city-specific ones
1.  Speak at a meetup
1.  Actively ask meetup organizers for feedback on your talks there
1.  Repeat the previous two steps a few times
1.  Start attending conferences

Attending meetups and conferences is helpful for seeing what does or doesn't work in talks.
What kinds of topics do you relate to as an attendee?
What speaking styles, narrative arcs, and general storytelling methods make you excited about the topic and/or effectively transmit information to you?
Keep track of these things and remember them for when you want to submit your talks.

## 2. Research the conference

TODO

-   Thoroughly read their website
-   Follow the conference and any organizers you can find on whatever social media you use
-   Watch talks from the most recent 1-2 iterations of the event

TODO

### Aside: Speaker Rider

I have a [speaker rider](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/speaker-rider), which is a declaration of the things I need in order to speak at an event.
That speaker rider consists only of must-haves that I think every event should do:

-   TODO

You don't need to have a speaker rider yourself.
I imagine my being a little more "demanding" (TODO WORDING) than many may hurt my chances for some conferences.

TODO

## 3. Determine Topic Matches

Now that I have a feel for what the conference is looking for, I'll try to see what areas of work I've spent time in match up with what they could look for.

## 4, Sketch the Story

TODO

## 5. Submit the CFP

TODO

## 6. Don't Get My Hopes Up

Applying to conferences is like to applying for jobs: you're going to rejected loads of times, especially when you're new.
Many CFP processes are chaotic and poorly managed behind the scenes, which introduces a strong element of random chance to which submissions of yours will get chosen.
Then, even if a CFP process is well-managed, your submission just might not match what the organizers are looking for.

Getting rejected is part of the process.
That's totally fine!
Just keep applying, and eventually others will go in.

## Miscellaneous tips

-   It's also totally fine to _not_ speak at conferences. Most developers don't.

## FAQs

### Can you still go to a conference that rejected your CFP submission?

Absolutely!
Many conferences will give discounts as thanks for submitting.

### Do you need to go to conferences to be a good developer?

Absolutely not.
Many developers don't.

Conferences can be great for learning and networking, but they're not for everyone.
If you don't want to spend a day in a conference center with a bunch of strangers, that's completely reasonable.

### Do you need to be active on Twitter to speak at conferences?

No, but it's very helpful.
There are a lot of developer communities and discussions on Twitter, and many conference TODO

### Do you need to be an expert on a subject to give a talk on it?

No.

TODO

### How do you know whether to submit to a conference?

If you're unsure, just submit.
You never know what the conference organizers will want to branch out to.

As long as you do the due diligence of finding topics that match between you and the conference

Remember: not all talks have to be technical.
I've seen fantastic talks at frontend-end conferences from low-level systems programmers on topics like mentorship and teamwork.

If you're still unsure, you can always ask the conference organizers over email.

### How can I find out about conferences?

I subscribe to as many newsletters, Twitter accounts, and automated services as possible.
That includes:

-   TODO CFPLAND AND THE REST

### I don't think I know enough about anything to give a talk. How do I find a topic?

_Wrong._
You absolutely do know enough to give a talk on something.

TODO

If you're really struggling to think of things, I'd suggest keeping a journal at work of the main lessons you learn.
TODO

### I have anxiety. Can I speak at conferences?

Hey, me too!
Anxiety pals!

Plenty of conference speakers have anxiety and/or plenty of other variations of being human.
I can't answer that question for you specifically though.
We're all different.

By the way, I recommend everybody get a therapist if they can.
Even if you don't think you need it.
Even if you think your body and mind are already perfect (which, frankly, is a sign on its own that you probably need therapy...).
A good therapist can be shockingly helpful for many personal issues, including but not limited to fear of drawing attention to yourself, self-doubt, and social anxiety.

### I'm giving my first talk soon and I'm nervous. What do I do?

You got your first talk accepted!
Congrats, that's great!
Give yourself a pat on the back. ðŸ˜Š

Everybody gets nervous before their first talk.
It's a natural part of the process.

If you can, try giving the talk to people you trust, such as coworkers, family, and friends.
Rehearse it ahead of time as much as you think is helpful, then stop rehearsing it and go do something that takes your mind off it.
I especially recommend something mentally and/or physically engaging, such as exercise, a particularly engrossing book, going out with a close friend or three, or an old favorite video game.

Plan something fun for after the talk to treat yourself.

When you're getting ready to start the talk, breathe deeply and calmly.
You've done everything you can.
Everybody knows public speaking can be nerve-wracking.
Nobody whose opinion is worth anything will judge you harshly on your first talk.

You got this!

### Is it ok to repeat talk submissions?

I think so, unless the conference explicitly states they prefer not.
Giving a talk multiple times allows you to iterate on it and give a better talk each time.
Most developers don't go to very many conferences per year, so the chances that they'll see you give the same talk twice are very small.

TODO MY STRATEGY

### My proposal was accepted, but I have to back out for personal reasons. What do I do?

Talk to the organizers as soon as possible, and give them as much information as you feel comfortable sharing.
They will understand: personal situations happen, and it's not their place to try to force you to do their event.

(if anybody does, please let me know so I don't waste my time applying to their conferences!)

Messages like the following are TODO PHRASING:

> Hi {organizer},
>
> I'm so sorry, something in my personal life came up and I can't speak at {conference} anymore.
> TODO
>
> Thanks again for choosing me and giving me this opportunity.
> I hope we can make this happen another time.
>
> -{you}

TODO SOMETHING ABOUT THANKING AND HEART REACTIONS

### My proposal was accepted, but I learned of something the conference does that makes me uncomfortable. What do I do?

Depends on the severity of the misdeed.
If it's something you'd feel comfortable talking to the organizers about, I highly recommend reaching out to them directly to raise your misgivings.
Oftentimes the organizer will appreciate you talking to them and will work hard to make it right.

Messages like the following are TODO PHRASING:

> Hi {organizer},
>
> I recently learned about {misdeed}.
> This is concerning to me because {reasons}.
>
> But, I want to hear your side of the story.
> Am I missing anything?
>
> Thanks!
> -{you}

If the bad deed is _really_ bad, though, it's absolutely fine to back out.
You don't want to help an event that violates your own moral code.

Messages like the following are TODO PHRASING:

> Hi {organizer},
>
> I recently learned about {misdeed}.
> This is concerning to me because {reasons}.
>
> I don't feel comfortable speaking at a conference that {description}, and must back out.
>
> Best, {you}.

If you got accepted at this one event, you can get accepted at some other one later on.
Don't feel obligated to stay with a bad group.
